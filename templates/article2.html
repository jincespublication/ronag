								<strong>THE UNWILLING GHANA?</strong><br>

								‘If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land’ –
								<br>
								<strong>Isaiah 1:19 (NKJV).</strong>
								<br>
								<br>
							</div>

								<p>
									<strong>Professor Nkwantabisa:</strong> Dr. Basabasa, what national issues are trending in Ghana?
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>Dr. Basabasa:</strong> Prof., they are too many. They range from actual to potential demonstrations and strikes, illegal mining (‘galamsey’), political hymnals in connection with the 2024 general election, political roads and other constructions, and of course the dry IMF economy and its ugly impact on businesses and Ghanaians. I nearly forgot of the issues concerning erratic power supply in some parts of the country and the agitations within the energy sector.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>Opanin Wisdom:</strong> I think the value of the issues you have outlined is the same- unwillingness and lawlessness!
								</p>
							
								<p>
									<strong>Dr. Basabasa:</strong> Opanin, what do you mean by their value is the same? Those on strike or demonstrating or threatening to demonstrate or strike are acting for different reasons. The politicians and their political parties are singing different hymns although some of the songs are similar. The galamsey menace is being discussed from different angles. As for the political constructions, energy sector issues and the dry IMF economy; they have common threads.
								</p>
							
								<p>
									<strong>Professor Nkwantabisa:</strong> Perhaps we should rather ask Opanin Wisdom to explain what he meant by unwillingness and lawlessness?
								</p>
							
								<p>
									<strong>Opanin Wisdom:</strong> All the issues enumerated come down to unwillingness and lawlessness. The demands of the various labour unions and the recent demands by Organised Labour on galamsey are not new. The demands of both the real and political demonstrators are also not new. In fact, all the demands are the same. The various demands and all the other issues Dr. Basabasa have enumerated demonstrate our unwillingness to do the needful which eventually breeds lawlessness and impunity. It seems to me that a number of our political leaders are both reactive and pretentious in their actions and inactions. The root cause of most of the issues outlined is the lack of commitment and fidelity on the part of especially our political actors and leaders. How many times haven’t successive Governments failed to carryout assurances made to several labour groups? Would we be talking about the adverse impact of galamsey today if our former and current Presidents willingly committed themselves to fight galamsey? Our unwillingness to timely approach IMF in 2022 has, for example, caused our nation unthinkable fortunes and sorrows.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>Dr. Basabasa:</strong> I now understand your earlier statement. I have been wondering why so many roads are either being constructed or being parched in this year in Ghana. Why are we now rushing to do the needful because of elections? I now get the sense that it is a sign of unwillingness. Could it also be vote buying?
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>Professor Nkwantabisa:</strong> Dishonest politicians, just like the devil, have no new tricks. They rather implement the same tricks differently depending on the context and personalities involved. Have you forgotten of the construction and inauguration of Kejatia Dubai and the Kwame Nkrumah Interchange? Dishonest politicians are the same except that they belong to different political parties.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>Opanin Wisdom:</strong> Motives are always important. Do not be deceived by what people do or say, even if they are good. What is their motive? Motive is everything. Wrong motives eventually destroy good deeds. Great nations are not built on political roads, political loans, political transactions, political promises and political speeches. What is the state of the political roads constructed in Ghana within the last decade?
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>Professor Nkwantabisa:</strong> We know the solutions to the challenges bedeviling our nation. The problem is that we are not willing to implement those solutions mainly due to greedy and selfish political decisions. Recent examples of this fact include the failure to implement the recommendations of the Constitutional Review Commission of Ghana since 2011, the fight against galamsey and the drama surrounding the Antigay Bill.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>Dr. Basabasa:</strong> Another major problem is that we are not ready to obey or submit to our laws, values and principles as a nation. The exceptions have become the norms and the norms have become the exceptions. This attitude has entrenched lawlessness, corruption, abuse of power and impunity in our nation.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>Opanin Wisdom:</strong> We can only benefit from the many good things in Ghana if we are willing and obedient. Great nations are built on the willingness to do the right things in the right way and at the right time, no matter the cost. The right willingness should spring from leaders first and then the citizenry. Leaders should be ready and willing to enforce relevant laws to ensure that all persons in Ghana align with the vision and goals of our great nation.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>Dr. Basabasa:</strong> The unwillingness on the part of leadership should not be the end of the matter. Where there is a will there is a way. We the citizenry should therefore be willing if our leaders are unwilling. Our collective interests are superior to political interests. Why are we wasting precious time discussing galamsey because of the unwillingness of some disappointed and uncaring leaders? If our political and traditional leaders are not willing because of some level of their complicity and greediness, what about the non-political actors in our nation? Ghana is a nation, not a political party nor a traditional dynasty. It is high time we put partisan politics aside and fight for the destiny of this nation. I am willing.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>Opanin Wisdom:</strong> I am also willing.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>Professor Nkwantabisa:</strong> I am equally willing. And I commend the Media Coalition of Ghana for their consistent willingness.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>Dr. Basabasa:</strong> Is Oraganised Labour truly willing? Is the Church willing? What about the CSOs, religious bodies, professional bodies, private sector and public institutions?
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>Opanin Wisdom:</strong> Indeed, silence is golden but there comes a time when silence and inactions are signs of betrayal, disloyalty and wickedness.
